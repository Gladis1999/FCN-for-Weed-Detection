# FCN-for-Weed-Detection
This is our final year project : ' Fully Convolutional Network for Weed Detection in Precision Farming '.

Weeds can be defined as any plant or vegetation that interferes with farming or forestry purposes, such as planting crops, grazing animals or planting forests. Weeds compete with plants for one or more aspects of plant growth such as mineral nutrients, water, solar energy and environment and inhibit plant performance. Therefore weed control is very important for plant growth. Traditional methods of weed control do not work effectively and the use of accurate farming plays a role. The next problem is finding the family of weeds and  the right herbicide to spray the weeds.

To overcome this difficulty, An android/ios app named 'Kisan Ki Dhosth(KKD)' is designed. This application clearly identifies the weed and identify the appropriate herbicide.This can be achieved by using the photograph taken by the farmer. The dataset consist of weeds which are widely seen in Kerala, making it more user-friendly for farmers.Since persistent use of herbicide remain active in environment for long period of time,potentially causing soil and water contamination,home remedies like salt,vinegar,newspaper and boiled water can control be used.
